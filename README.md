# Folia Builder v1.0 by GluconFix

## Overview

Folia Builder, developed by GluconFix, simplifies the build process for Folia, a Minecraft Server Software available at [PaperMC/Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia). Please note that Folia intentionally does not provide public builds to avoid unwarranted complaints about functionality issues. Folia is not recommended for production use.

## Important Note

- **Language:** The documentation and communication for this project are in English.
- **Issue Handling:** I will only address issues if a solution is provided along with the problem description.
- **License:** The source code is completely open to the public under the MIT License.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Admin Privileges:** The program requires administrative privileges to execute, as all actions take place in the root of the drive. The files are copied to the executable's folder at the end of the process due to a limitation with path length.

## Download Instructions

To download Folia Builder, follow these steps:

1. Install Java 17 or higher
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): Ensure that Git is installed on your system.
3. C++ Development Environment: If Mingw for C++ development is not set up on your system, you may need to download and install the required DLL files attached to the release and put them into the same directory as the exe file or inside a folder specified in the OS path variable.

## Caution

- **Production Use:** Folia is not suitable for production. If you intend to replace Paper with Folia, it is advisable to wait for official Folia builds before doing so.
