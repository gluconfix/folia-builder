# Folia Builder v1.0 by GluconFix

## Overview

Folia Builder, developed by GluconFix, serves the purpose of simplifying the build process for Folia, a Minecraft Server Software available at [PaperMC/Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia). It is important to note that Folia intentionally does not provide public builds to prevent unwarranted complaints about functionality issues. Folia is not recommended for production use.

## Important Note

- **Language:** The documentation and communication for this project are in English.
- **Issue Handling:** I will only address issues if a solution is provided along with the problem description.
- **License:** The source code is completely open to the public under the MIT License.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Admin Privileges:** The program requires administrative privileges to execute, as all actions take place in the root of the drive. The files are copied to the executable's folder at the end of the process due to a limitation with path length.

## Caution

- **Production Use:** Folia is not suitable for production. If you intend to replace Paper with Folia, it is advisable to wait for official Folia builds before doing so.
